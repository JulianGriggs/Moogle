What kind of machine did you use to run your experiments? 
Give the processor, number of cores, if you are using a VM.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Intel i7, 4, not using vm


Comment *briefly* on the chunking procedure in your sequence 
implementation. What did you find effective? What did you 
find ineffective? How many chunks did you use?
----------------------------------------------------

We ended up using the same number of chunks as cores. We played around 
with multiples of that number, but found that using num_cores did the best




Comments, Problems and Design Decisions:
----------------------------------------

Did not complete scan.  Therefore part 3 currently uses the ListSeq 
implementation


Suggestions for the Future or Random Comments:
